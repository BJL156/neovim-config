# Neovim Config
This is my Neovim config which was heavily based off of typecraft's tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yqSdvAKXY&list=PLsz00TDipIffxsNXSkskknolKShdbcALR

# Install
1. Go to the nvim directory (typically C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\nvim by default on Windows).
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/BJL156/neovim-config`.
3. Open Neovim and ignore any errors.
4. Let packer.nvim do its thing.
5. Restart Neovim.
